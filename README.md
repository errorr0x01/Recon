# Project Ares - The Perfected Offensive Reconnaissance Engine

Project Ares is a powerful, self-learning, and fully integrated reconnaissance engine designed for elite bug bounty hunters and security researchers. It operates at zero cost, leveraging a suite of best-in-class open-source tools to autonomously discover, analyze, and pivot on vulnerabilities to conquer a target's entire attack surface.

This is not just a scanner; it is a strategic weapon that thinks.

## Key Features

-   **Self-Learning Combat AI**: Ares's intelligence is entirely self-generated. It learns from every vulnerability it finds and uses that knowledge to predict and propagate threats across the target's entire infrastructure via its **Threat Propagation Engine**.
-   **Strategic Infrastructure Prediction**: It doesn't just find what's there; it predicts what *should* be there. It analyzes naming conventions (`prod`, `dev`, `staging`) to uncover non-obvious, sibling infrastructure.
-   **Absolute Zero-Cost**: Every module, from discovery to exploitation, uses free methods and open-source tooling. There are no hidden costs or required API keys.
-   **Unrivaled Discovery**: Integrates advanced discovery techniques including subdomain enumeration, historical URL analysis, ASN/CIDR network block discovery, and Favicon correlation.
-   **Deep Asset Analysis**: Dissects assets by detecting technology and versions, performing visual recon, mining for hidden parameters, and generating custom, target-specific wordlists for deep content discovery.
-   **Visual Kill Chain Mapping**: It doesn't just give you logs; it draws you a map of its victory. It generates a visual graph of its entire attack path, from initial foothold to final compromise.
-   **Built-in Safety & Professionalism**: Includes a mandatory `--i-have-permission` flag to enforce responsible use and a `--dry-run` mode for safe reconnaissance.
